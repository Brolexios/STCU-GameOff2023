Takes place in the city

Cat chasing a flying fish and jump from tree to tree

Jump and accurrately land on objects while fish is flying away and the jump mechanic is a charge up.
Cat is on a scale, you charge up and whack the scale and launches the cat into the air.

Scuba cat!!!
Propel itself deeper and darker and impairs vision.
Can pick up lights along the way.
All to catch a fish.

Get as far as you can before you run out of oxygen and collect all the things.
Stuff needs to be interesting and exciting.
Bring in sub with billionaires, economic scaling.
SCUBA CAT

BOSS FIGHT: CAT VS. SHARK named Bruce

Scratch that, play as fish and boss is cat.
Fish can be anchovies or minnows for scale.

CAT BILLIARDS knocking stuff off the table.

### Agreed upon stuff:

Game will be 2D
Game will incorporate cats and fish
Ideas are like side scrolling shooter, brotato like vampire game, or scuba cat game

### First steps

Add background, and main character box
Add movement to main character box
Add collision detection to main character box
Add "fish" character box as well

Make prototype

## SCUBA CAT IS A FOR SURE

Cat collecting fish scales from the bottom of the ocean.

Fish involved because fish have scales.

One small cat in the big ocean for scale.

Pirate cat?

Cat is a pirate and is looking for treasure.
Scales are treasure.

Could incorporate pirate ship into 1 level.
1 level could be crossing a jelly fish nebula.

MAKE an acronym for SCALE
